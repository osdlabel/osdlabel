# @osdlabel/geometry

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- c77c661: Add circle→rectangle conversion and interactive polygon/polyline vertex editing.
  - Convert a selected circle to its axis-aligned bounding rectangle via a contextual, constraint-aware "Convert to Rect" toolbar button, backed by the pure `circleToBoundingRectangle` helper.
  - Edit polygon/polyline vertices: a configurable long-press enters a sticky edit mode with per-vertex move handles and edge-midpoint insertion handles; Delete/Backspace removes a vertex (min 3 polygon / 2 polyline). Reachable from the Select, Polyline, and Free-draw tools; long-press timing/tolerance are Annotator-level options.
  - New `@osdlabel/geometry` package holds the geometry math and conversions; `@osdlabel/decoration` re-exports the math so the public API is unchanged.

### Patch Changes
